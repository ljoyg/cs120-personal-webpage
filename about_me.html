    <h2 name="section-title">My 2026 Trip to the Philippines</h2>
    <p name="travel-body">This January I traveled to the Philippines with my partner – 
        I am actually creating this webpage from an airport lounge on my way home! 
        My partner's mom is from the Philippines, so we traveled there to visit his family.
        We also took some time to explore some of the islands off of the mainland in Palawan, 
        an area of the country known for its beautiful tropical beaches.
        I especially loved snorkeling at Shimizu Island, where I got to see various tropical fish and coral!</p>

    <h2 name="section-title">My Favorite Restaurant</h2>
    <p>My favorite restaurant is <a href="https://www.thaidiner.com/" target="_blank">Thai Diner</a>! 
        This is my favorite restaurant because I love Thai Food, and on top of having amazing food they have a great atmosphere.
        My favorite dishes are the Lamb Laab and the Thai Coffee Monster dessert!</p>

    My favorite food is potatoes! I love them for their versatility. 
    They're good mashed, roasted, baked, fried, in a soup, or in a stew.
    My favorite way to eat them is in loaded baked potato soup.
